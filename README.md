Thank you so much for attending my talk!  I've just uploaded my slide deck.  Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions.  I'm on LinkedIn, Mastodon (@timjclevenger@infosec.exchange) and Discord (my handle is 'nsfw' on the Physical Security and DEFCON 512 Discords.)

I will be uploading the promised RFP in the next day or so; I just want to add some additional things based on recent experience and talking with others.
